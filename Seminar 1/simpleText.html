		The Internet is the interconnected network of computer networks. It was
		developed in the 1960s by the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA),
		US Department of Defense. Planning started in 1966, and by 1969, four
		computers were connected. Originally, use of the Internet was limited to
		government and academia, but a ban on commercial use was lifted in 1991, 		leading to huge growth, so that the World Wide Web was introduced in
		1992. Today, billions of users use the Internet daily all over the world.
